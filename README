# Mapgen

My uniherz titan keymap can be found in out.json.
It's currently written by hand from the definitions in
keys.map. The plan is to write a tool that converts the
ASCII maps to JSON format for Key Mapper. Don't know
when I'll find the time for it.

Check out Key Mapper if you haven't already. It's the
single most important software on my phone. Worth it!
